# passwd
A platform for enacting online privacy.

## > Problem

In Australia currently, [privacy is a major concern for 70% of australians](https://www.oaic.gov.au/engage-with-us/research/australian-community-attitudes-to-privacy-survey-2020-landing-page/2020-australian-community-attitudes-to-privacy-survey) (mostly about our location being tracked through our browser or mobile \[62%\]). Yet despite the media and news about mass surveillance and hackers causing havoc all around the world only 49% of australians know how to enact privacy online. This includes 16% of asking organizations why they need personal information, 13% not using an app because of privacy handling reasons and only 10% adjusting their privacy settings on social media apps! [\[1\]](https://www.oaic.gov.au/engage-with-us/research/australian-community-attitudes-to-privacy-survey-2020-landing-page/2020-australian-community-attitudes-to-privacy-survey)

Even with the low number of australians taking action to improve their privacy there are also a lot of successful phishing attacks. 64% of australians have encountered phishing attacks and 37% have fallen victim, requiring them to change their online passwords and such.

Another reason that australians are getting hacked is that 60% use their password for more than one platform. This allows bad actors to go through big password breaches and dumps to find a password to an account and test accounts with that password. According to [this study](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/beyond-password-length-complexity/), 61% of passwords in a dataset of 5000 were only 8 or 9 characters! This allows bad actors to use [wordlists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords) to crack common passwords. IRL example: 5 of my friends social media accounts were hacked within a week because they had passwords that were in rockyou.txt, the largest common password database in all bad actor's toolkits.

The main problem today is that there aren't enough resources explaining (in laymans terms) how to protect yourself online and take action against organizations collecting massive amounts of data that they don't need.
